# e-wallet
I forgot my electrum 2fa wallet password. Hello! there is a seed, an authenticator. After restoring my wallet, my account balance is empty. I tried to solve the problem like this, I downloaded the seedtester from the github site, inserted the seed into the BIP39 mnemonic to search for private keys to import into the wallet, it didnâ€™t work, all the lines are empty. It seems because of 2fa protection. please, does anyone know what can i do to get my bitcoins back?
